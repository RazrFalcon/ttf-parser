# Enables variable fonts support. Adds about 50KiB.
variable-fonts = ["ttf-parser/variable-fonts"]
# Enables heap allocations during gvar table parsing used by Apple's variable fonts.
# Due to a way gvar table is structured, we cannot avoid allocations.
# By default, only up to 32 variable tuples will be allocated on the stack,
# while the spec allows up to 4095. Most variable fonts use 10-20 tuples at most,
# so our limit is suitable for most of the cases. But if you need the full support, you have to
# enable this feature.
gvar-alloc = ["ttf-parser/gvar-alloc"]
# opentype-layout is not supported.
